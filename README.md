# classroom-accommodations-api

This is an API I am creating that will provide the following information:

<li>Learning disability's name
<li>Explanations of learning diability
<li>Important Reminder
<li>Trouble Areas
<li>Recommended accommodations for learning disability

This API is free to use through Heroku.

This API has been designed as a part of a larger project to help provide teachers with recommended accommodations for students in their classroom who have diagnosed and potentially undiagnosed learning disablities that cause them to struggle in the classroom.

All information about the learning disabilities and recommendations has been taken from <a href="https://www.understood.org/">Understood.org</a>.

If there are errors or more updated information available, please feel free to contact me or submit a pull request to update the information.
Please be sure to provide reliable and trustworthy resources for any changes made to the current data.
